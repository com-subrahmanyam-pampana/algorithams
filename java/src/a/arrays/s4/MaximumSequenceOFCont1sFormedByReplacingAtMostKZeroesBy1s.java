/*
 Given a binary array, find the maximum sequence of continuous 1’s that can be formed by replacing at most k zeroes by ones.

For example, consider the following binary array A:

Input: A[] = { 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0 }
 
 
For k = 0,
The length of the longest sequence is 4 (from index 6 to 9)
 
For k = 1,
The length of the longest sequence is 7 (from index 3 to 9)
 
For k = 2,
The length of the longest sequence is 10 (from index 0 to 9)
 
For k = 3,
The length of the longest sequence is 11 (from index 0 to 10)
